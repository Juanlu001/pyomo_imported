We are pleased to announce the release of Pyomo 3.5 (3.5.8787). Pyomo is a collection of Python software packages that supports a diverse set of optimization capabilities for formulating and analyzing optimization models.

The following are highlights of this release:

- Modeling
   * Can now model bilevel programs
   * Can now model mathematical programs with equillibrium constraints
   * Added explicit support for model transformations

- Solvers
   * Updates for CBC, Cplex and Gurobi solvers
   * Added support for NEOS solvers (using Kestrel interface)
   * Added preliminary support for persistent solvers

- Other
   * Added the 'pyomo.environ' package, which initializes Pyomo plugins
   * Renamed 'pyomo.plugins' to 'pyomo.solvers'
   * Cleanup and code reviews of core pyomo.pyomo components
   * The 'pyomo' command contains better documentation of installed capabilities
   * The 'pyomo_install' script is now recommended for installation on Linux and OS X 
   * MS Windows installers for Pyomo 3.5 are coming soon ...

See https://software.sandia.gov/trac/pyomo/wiki/Documentation for installation options and documentation for getting started with Pyomo.  

Enjoy!

About Pyomo
-----------

Pyomo is a collection of Python software packages that supports a diverse set of optimization capabilities for formulating and analyzing optimization models.

Modeling optimization applications is a core capability of Pyomo. Pyomo can be used to define symbolic problems, create concrete problem instances, and solve these instances with standard solvers. Thus, Pyomo provides a capability that is commonly associated with algebraic modeling languages.  Further, Pyomo supports analysis and scripting within a full-featured programming language.

Pyomo has also proven an effective framework for developing high-level optimization and analysis tools. For example, the PySP package provides generic solvers for stochastic programming.  PySP leverages the fact that Pyomo's modeling objects are embedded within a full-featured high-level programming language, which allows for transparent parallelization of subproblems using Python parallel communication libraries.

Pyomo development is hosted by Sandia National Laboratories and COIN-OR:
